# Vúbec Tire Shop Reservation System

Congratulations! Our Spring Boot project, developed by Team "vúbec," emerged as the winner in the IBM-CZM Hackathon. We are excited to present our innovative solution to address the challenges faced by tire shop owners, who often struggle with managing reservations, handwritten notes, and customer reminders. Our project aims to streamline this process, providing a more efficient and organized solution.

## Problem Statement

The tire shop owner's main issues were identified as follows:
1. Frequent interruptions due to phone calls for booking appointments.
2. Manual entry of reservation details into Excel from handwritten notes.
3. Occasional issues with customers forgetting their appointments.

## Solution

We tackled these challenges by creating a comprehensive reservation system that automates the booking process and improves customer communication:

1. **Online Reservation:** Customers can now easily book appointments online without the need for phone calls, reducing interruptions for the shop owner.

2. **Confirmation Email:** Upon booking, customers receive a confirmation email, ensuring that their reservation details are stored electronically and eliminating the need for handwritten notes.

3. **Reminder Emails:** One day before the appointment, our system sends reminder emails to both the customer and the shop owner, reducing no-shows and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

## Tools Used

Our project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **Camunda Modeler:** We utilized Camunda for workflow modeling and management, enabling smooth automation of the reservation process.

- **Spring Boot:** The backbone of our project, Spring Boot, provides a robust and scalable foundation for our application.

- **Java:** We employed Java for backend development, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

- **Canva:** For creating a user-friendly and visually appealing user interface.
